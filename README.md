# A-Statistical-Analysis-of-Used-Car-Sales-Data

Used car sales is one of the largest turnover business in the automotive industry. There are numerous car companies evolved over the years all over the globe and Belarus auto market is one of the fastest growing vehicle markets in Europe, which is very well known for famous/prestigious car models and brands. In this project I am going to analyze the dataset collected from Belarus online catalog and verify the association between different factors and how these variables affect the selling price of the car. Also, to build a price- prediction model for vehicles sold by the online sellers.


As an aspiring car buyer, I always visit numerous websites to look for available car options. I wonder how the seller decides the car price and what are the variables that influence the selling cost. So, this analysis will help me to better understand the pricing strategy used by the car sellers. Also, many times when used car is sold, buyer or seller takes an advantage. So, the prediction model should help in optimizing the price, so that neither buyer nor seller will lose money.


This dataset is collected from various popular online used car catalogs in Belarus (West Europe).

• The average price of the cars produced between 2000-2010 are greater than cars produced between 1990-2000.


• Analyze how the average price of the car differs among different types of drive trains.


• Build the multiple linear regression model for used car price prediction
